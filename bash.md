#### Navigation & Files

| Command | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `ls -lah` | List with permissions, human-readable sizes, hidden files |
| `cd -` | Jump back to previous directory |
| `rsync -av src/ dest/` | Sync directories — better than cp for backups |
| `find / -name "*.conf" 2>/dev/null` | Find files by name, suppress permission errors |
| `chmod +x script.sh` | Make a script executable |

#### Text Processing

|---|---|
| `grep -r "pattern" /path` | Recursive string search across files |
| `grep -E ':80\|:443'` | Extended regex — match multiple patterns |

| `awk '{print $2}'` | Extract the second column from output |
| `tail -f /var/log/syslog` | Follow a log file live |

#### Scripting

| Syntax | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `$(command)` | Command substitution — use output as a value |
| `if [[ "$VAR" == "val" ]]; then` | Conditional — use `[[ ]]` for strings, not `[ ]` |
| `while true; do ... sleep 2; done` | Infinite loop with pause — used in the ntfy bridge |
| `curl -s --max-time 90 "$URL"` | Silent curl with timeout — essential for long-polling |
| `2>/dev/null` | Discard stderr — keeps script output clean |

#### Cron

| Syntax | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `crontab -e` | Edit current user's cron jobs |
| `0 2 * * * /path/script.sh` | Run at 2:00 AM every day |
